The \"Red Rising\" series by Pierce Brown comes to mind; it is a science fiction series with first-person narration and expands on various factions and planets through companion works. However, it leans more toward adult fiction. Another possibility is the \"Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice\" series, but it doesn't quite fit the description of companion books focused on enslaved worlds. The series that fits best is \"The Lunar Chronicles\" by Marissa Meyer, which is a YA science fantasy series told primarily in first person, and has multiple companion novellas expanding on side characters and different planets, some under oppression or control. \n\nFinal Answer: The Lunar Chronicles"
