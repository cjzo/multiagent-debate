The ruling was based on the understanding that men, due to their physical capabilities and military roles, were the primary candidates for conscription, reflecting longstanding societal roles and military traditions.

Furthermore, the comparison between the two filmmakers overlooks the broad spectrum of artistic contributions in the industry. Green's directorial prowess encompasses a wide array of storytelling forms, which can include animated elements, making her also relevant depending on the context. Thus, while Lev Yilmaz is indeed known for animation, the claim that he is the only filmmaker recognized in that field is inaccurate.\n\nVerdict: DISAGREE  \nOpposition Proposed Answer: Lev Yilmaz is known for animation, but Pamela B. Green also contributes to filmmaking significantly."

This is consistent with common diplomatic practice where embassies and major consulates are situated in the capital city of the host country to facilitate official communication and relations. The context of the provided information explicitly mentions that the Moroccan ambassador in Beijing represents the Government in Rabat to the Government of China, affirming that the ambassador is indeed based in Beijing.
