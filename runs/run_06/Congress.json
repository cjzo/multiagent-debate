As the official representative of Morocco, the ambassador functions within the broader framework of diplomatic relations, which typically places embassies in capital cities.

The diplomat representing a specific region like Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra may not necessarily be stationed in Beijing, as traditional ambassadorships pertain to national relations rather than regional administrative regions. To assume that the ambassador of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra region is based in Beijing without specific evidence to that effect is unjustified.

In contrast, Fuding is classified as a county-level city, indicating it is a smaller administrative entity under the jurisdiction of a higher-level prefecture or city.
