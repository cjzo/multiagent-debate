Goldberg upheld the constitutionality of requiring only men to register for the draft as a legitimate means of filling vacancies in the Armed Forces. The Court determined that the gender distinction did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as Congress had a legitimate interest in having men serve in combat roles due to the nature of military service at that time. The ruling was based on an assessment of the differences in roles and responsibilities between male and female servicemembers, aligning with the government's rationale that the draft was primarily for combat positions, which were not open to women. Thus, the practice of limiting draft registration to men was deemed acceptable under the legal standards of that period.\n\nProposed Answer: requiring only men to register for the draft."
